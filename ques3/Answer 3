Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?
Multiple inheritance is not supported in java because it make make our compiler to go into ambiguous state.
For example, suppose I have :-
A class, B class and C class.
A class has :-
	public class A{
		public void hi()
		{
			System.out.println("Hi");
		}
	}

And class B also has :-
	public class B{
		public void hi()
		{
			System.out.println("Hi");
		}
	}
	
Now if I try to extend both A and B in C class :-
	public class C extends A,B{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			C c = new C();
			c.hi();
		}
	}
	Now, since both A and B have same methods our compiler will get confused about which class' method it should call and that is why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java at classlevel.
